## Week 8

## Peer assessment:

The whole team worked hard together to get the project presentable enough, Ivan finished login, Max and me worked on the frontend and I made the presentation for us

## Challenges faced

Crunch time! Stress! Raining cats and dogs!

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

We made it! We should learn to front-load these projects sow e don't get so stressed at the end

## Coping Strategies:

We have been better at meeting each other and talking about our expectations and work, especially now on the last week.

Trello and Discord are still being actively used

## Final Thoughts:

We did it!
