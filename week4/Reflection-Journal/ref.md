# Reflection journal

## Jan Falck

## Week 4

## Peer assessment:

1. Jan: I had to be largely absent from the lectures but I kept in touch with the others and I coded the majority of the JSX we are using

2. Ivan: Ivan looked a lot at the backend side of things and contributed significant amounts of code

3. Max: Max continued making more figma files and frontend planning

## Challenges faced

Schedule problems mostly, once again!

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Starting to get the hang of the tools, the power of management tools has been learned, we have been using trello a lot more now

## Coping Strategies:

More meetings and discussion

## Project Management:

Trello and Discord are being more actively used

## Final Thoughts:

Sprint 2 pretty much finished

## Next Steps:

We need to perhaps tone down our MVP, given the limited time we have
