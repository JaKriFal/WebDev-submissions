# Reflection journal

## Jan Falck

## Week 1

## Peer assessment:

1. Jan: I participated well in our discussions and I think I kind of broke the ice with the other two members very well. I maybe took a little bit of a leading role in the discussions, but just to keep it flowing

2. Ivan: I felt Ivan was easy to work and discuss the topics and the coming project with, easy to work with, did his part

3. Max: Same comment for Max as Ivan, Max also had some good ideas what kind of web app we could be making

## Challenges faced

No challenges in particular, except forming the group itself, but that sorted itself out

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Mostly everything went very well, I have learned a couple of new tricks, but npm, git etc. was all very familiar to me to begin with. I hve also started (re)familiarising myself with project management tools like Trello.

## Coping Strategies:

None were needed this week, except maybe a strong cup of coffee because of the long lesson on thursday!

## Project Management:

We already started brainstorming the app and we exchanged contact info with the team and formed a discord and additional workspaces!

## Final Thoughts:

I have a good feeling about the group and the coming project.

## Next Steps:

Next week is the final week of Sprint 1, so we will be making and finishing our frontend prototype!
