# Reflection journal

## Week 5

## Peer assessment:

1. Jan: Looked more into routing and improving the JSX, I've mostly been doing frontend

2. Ivan: Ivan hs been doing backend, he could maybe participate in discussions more but he is putting in the work

3. Max: Max is doing graphical design stuff mostly, also helped me with some JSX, no complaints

## Challenges faced

Schedule problems mostly, once again! ALso the pace is pretty fast but I think we are coping with it
