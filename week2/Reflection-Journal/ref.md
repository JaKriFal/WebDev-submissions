# Reflection journal

## Jan Falck

## Week 2

## Peer assessment:

1. Jan: I participated well in our discussions and I did mypart in designing the app

2. Ivan: Ivan was a bit absent on week 2

3. Max: Max was with me the driving force here, I feel Max has more experience as a user and I have more backend experience

## Challenges faced

Getting people to work together, finding time to scrum and then turning those ideas to practical solutions

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

We have very well defined workflows in Discord and Figma, and we also got an ok product backlog in our github, we might need to make it more clear what everyone needs to work on using tools like trello

## Coping Strategies:

Here at the start the only coping strats that were needed were just doing the work, it hasn't been particularly difficult yet

## Project Management:

We've had some good discussions on our discord and I've made some channels there to discuss differnet things, a Trello might be in order

## Final Thoughts:

I have a good feeling about the group and the coming project. Still feeling this!

## Next Steps:

Sprint 2 we need to make some actual stuff, and this project is a bit ambitious
